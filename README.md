## Project Proposal

The project was started to practice programming logic and object-oriented concepts in the python language.

## Game Theme

The game model was made based on games like POU(hence the name of the project), for android devices, and the classic Tamagotchi. In other words, the game is about the user's interaction with a virtual pet, giving him virtual affection, virtual food, virtual bath, virtual care, etc.

## Creator's Notes

- At the end of the project, I will try to generate an .exe file for anyone who wants to test the game, regardless of having python installed on the machine.
- All sprites used in project at this moment, are temporary. At end of project the final sprites will be inserted.
